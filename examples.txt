['mentalhealth', ' I 17M consider myself extremely fortunate in terms of upbringing and personally have no family issues or traumatic events that can cause me to feel this way.One week ago I had stumbled upon a post which was very much bait stating that did you know guys need to insert a toothpick even in their penises to unclog them every once in a while. For some reason this post that I had simply looked at for a few seconds managed to stick in my head for a very long timeI have now constantly been thinking about this fact and constantly imagine someone forcibly sticking a sharp needle or toothpick through my dick hole. It has gotten to a point where I am no longer able to read books or watch videos as there is always a tingling sensation around my dick. I would absolutely love to rewind time to when I never saw that post which is no longer possible any suggestions to alleviate this issue of mine would be greatly appreciatedThanks!']
